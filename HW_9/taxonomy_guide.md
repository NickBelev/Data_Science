## Taxonomy Guide for University Subreddits

This taxonomy was developed as a means to classify every observable Reddit post that someone (typically students) might make on r/mcgill or r/concordia. The goal is to use these annotations on samples of posts from McGill's and Concordia's subreddits to compare the general focus of discussion, priorities, and interests, and to assess the overall similarity in culture between the two schools. This will be determined based on how closely the proportion of each type in the taxonomy is encountered in the annotated samples.

### Categories:

- **exams_and_projects**
- **courses_and_grades**

### Edge Cases

#### **Exams and Projects vs. Courses and Grades**
- "Is PHYS 102 with Professor X easier since his test are open book" (Leans toward *courses_and_grades* since it’s about the course overall, even though it mentions a detail about the exam.)
  
- "HIST 442 final is not cumulative!!" (*exams_and_projects* because it's specific to an assessment though it mentions a course.)

#### **Courses and Grades vs. Academic Clubs**
- "The Computer Science Club recommends taking COMP 206—any thoughts?" (Leans towards *academic_clubs* since the club has a soft requirement about *courses_and_grades* to be a productive club member.)

- "Anyone in the Debate Society taken POLI 342?" (Person is likely looking for help with *courses_and_grades*, even though they are asking people from *academic_clubs*, so, it is categorized as *courses_and_grades* for course-specific help.)

#### **Personal Help vs. Campus Tips**
- "Does anyone know if the Law Library’s 24/7 room is open during reading week?" (*campus_tips* because it's about campus facilities, and not *personal_help*.)

- "I lost my HABS jersey in Conco's Lib Floor 3" (*personal_help* since it’s about finding a personal belonging, in a campus location.)

#### **Social and Events vs. Campus Tips**
- "Superbowl watch party at the student bar or the rec room?" (Leans towards *social_and_events* since it's about a social gathering, but has reference to *campus_tips*.)

- "If you're going to the poster fair, go early avoid crowd!" (*campus_tips* as it's advice about navigating more than about the event itself.)

#### **Career Help vs. Academic Clubs**
- "Does the Finance Club have any workshops on resume building?" (*academic_clubs* because it’s about what the club offers, even though it also relates to *career_help*.)

- "Anyone know if networking events hosted by the Economics Society are helpful for landing internships?" (This person's priority is an internship, so they want *career_help*, and are willing to seek it out from *academic_clubs*.  Classify as *career_help*.)
